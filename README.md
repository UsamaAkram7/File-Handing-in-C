# File-Handing-in-C

+++++++++++++++++INSTRUCTION TO RUN THE PROGRAM++++++++++++++++++++++

OPen visual studio or any C++ compiler and you can run it there.
Or you can run it using LINUX terminal by using the command line arguments 
Happy Coding :)

Assignment Statement:
This assignment will be a revision to the concepts and implementations of file handling and that in C programming language. We shall see some must know and basic functions.
The basic functions are:
1)	Opening/Creating a file
2)	Closing a file
3)	Reading a file
4)	Writing in a file

Implemented Task :
1)	Write a program to read a file and count the number of digits in it. The file may contain an alphanumeric string.
2)	Write a program to manage record of student registration on file. Enter your details and the details of two of your classmates. Roll no, Name and Email should be saved as student details. Example Record:
Name: Usama Akram
Roll No. L15-4248
Email: l154248@lhr.nu.edu.pk
	Take input via command line argument or user input.
THe program should do the following:
a.	Allow Adding students
b.	Read student record from file. (Program must take input from user to read a record. E.g. “0” to read your record, “1” and “2” to read record of fellow student.)
c.	Delete student record in file. (Program must take input from user to delete a record. E.g. “0” to delete your record, “1” and “2” to delete record of fellow student.)
3)	Write a program that reverses all the characters of words that are not vowels in a given file.
NOTE: Task 1 and 3 should accept a command line argument which will indicate which file to use for answer validation. For example, the input to task 1 can be something like this:
>  ./program.out a
OR
>  ./program.out b
Where “a” and “b” indicate files q1_a.txt and q1_b.txt respectively as input that are provided in the zip file.
